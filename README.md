TwentyEleven Child Theme
============================

Child theme for TwentyEleven. It has a basic override folder and some CSS overrides for the List Events widget for The Events Calendar 3.x.

Download and use as a base for a child theme with TwentyEleven as a base theme. If you wish to use TwentyTwelve as a base theme you'll need to make a few modifications to the `sytle.css` file.

To do this change the headers to the following.

	/*
	Theme Name: TwentyEleven Child
	Theme URI: https://github.com/afragen/twentyeleven-child
	Github Theme URI: https://github.com/afragen/twentyeleven-child
	Description: Child-Theme of TwentyTwelve.
	Author: Andy Fragen
	Template: twentytwelve
	Version: 0.1
	*/

And change the @import line to this, `@import url("../twentytwelve/style.css");`

If you use a base theme other than TwentyEleven the List Events widget override CSS may look different.
